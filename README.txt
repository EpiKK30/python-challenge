# python-challenge

**Repository Name:** python-challenge

**Description:**
The Python Challenge repository contains solutions to two ('Module 3 Challenge') Python challenges: PyBank and PyPoll. Both challenges simulate real-world scenarios where Python scripting skills are crucial for data analysis and automation tasks.

**Project Structure:**
- **PyBank:**
  - **main.py:** Python script for analyzing financial data.
  - **Resources:** Folder containing the financial dataset (`budget_data.csv`).
  - **Analysis:** Folder containing the analysis results text file (`budget_analysis.txt`).

- **PyPoll:**
  - **main.py:** Python script for analyzing poll data.
  - **Resources:** Folder containing the poll dataset (`election_data.csv`).
  - **Analysis:** Folder containing the analysis results text file (`election_analysis.txt`).

**Instructions:**
Before running the scripts, follow these steps:
1. **Clone Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. **Navigate to Repository:** Open your terminal and navigate to the cloned repository directory.
3. **Run Scripts:** Run each script separately by executing `python main.py` within the respective project directories (`PyBank` and `PyPoll`).
4. **Verify Results:** Check the analysis results in the corresponding `Analysis` folders.

**Project Overview:**
- **PyBank:**
  - Analyzes financial data to calculate total months, net total profit/loss, average change, and identifies the greatest increase and decrease in profits.
  - Utilizes Python's `csv` module for reading CSV files and handles data using variables, lists, and dictionaries.

- **PyPoll:**
  - Modernizes a small, rural town's vote-counting process by analyzing poll data.
  - Calculates total votes cast, lists of candidates who received votes, percentages of votes each candidate won, and determines the winner of the election based on popular vote.
  - Utilizes Python's file handling capabilities and data structures like lists and dictionaries.

**Hints and Considerations:**
- Use the `csv` module to handle CSV files effectively.
- Employ variables, lists, and dictionaries to store and manipulate data.
- Break down tasks into smaller objectives for efficient problem-solving.
- Debug code as needed to identify and fix errors.
- Ensure correct file paths for loading datasets and outputting analysis results.

**Backup and Version Control:**
- Regularly commit your work to maintain version history and back it up by pushing changes to GitHub.

**Additional Notes:**
- Each script operates independently, analyzing its respective dataset.
- Remember to review the `README.md` file within each project folder for specific instructions and details.
